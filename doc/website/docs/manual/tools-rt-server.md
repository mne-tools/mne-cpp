# mne_rt_server

## Overview

`mne_rt_server` is a real-time FIFF data streaming server. It manages connectors (plugins like FiffSimulator) and streams FIFF data to connected clients over a network.

## Usage

```bash
mne_rt_server [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-f, --file <filePath>` | FIFF file to stream via the FiffSimulator plugin |

## Description

`mne_rt_server` enables real-time streaming of FIFF-formatted MEG/EEG data over a network connection. It serves as the data source for real-time processing applications such as `mne_scan`.

### Architecture

The server uses a plugin-based connector architecture:

- **FiffSimulator** — Streams pre-recorded FIFF files as if they were being acquired in real-time
- Additional connectors can be loaded for different data sources

### Use Cases

- Testing real-time processing pipelines with pre-recorded data
- Streaming data between networked computers
- Providing a standardized interface for real-time data access

## Example

Start the server streaming a sample data file:

```bash
mne_rt_server --file sample_audvis_raw.fif
```
