# Contributing to the Website

This page shows you how to contribute to MNE-CPP's documentation website. As with other code contributions, you will need to fork MNE-CPP's repository on GitHub and then submit a pull request.

The documentation website is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and lives inside the repository at `doc/website/`. Content pages are written in Markdown (`.md` files) and can be found in `doc/website/docs/`.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) installed.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd doc/website
npm install
```

### Start a Local Development Server

```bash
npx docusaurus start
```

This launches a local server (typically at `http://localhost:3000/`) with hot-reload — any changes you save to `.md` or configuration files will be reflected in the browser immediately.

### Build for Production

To verify your changes produce a clean production build:

```bash
npx docusaurus build
```

The build will catch broken links and other issues. Fix any errors before submitting your pull request.

### Serve the Production Build

```bash
npx docusaurus serve
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Navigate to `doc/website/docs/` and edit or add Markdown files.
3. If you add a new page, register it in `doc/website/sidebars.ts`.
4. Preview your changes locally with `npx docusaurus start`.
5. Run `npx docusaurus build` to verify there are no broken links.
6. Commit, push, and open a pull request.
