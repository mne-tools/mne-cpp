We use a variety of different tools to develop and maintain MNE-CPP. We use [GitHub](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to host the source code for MNE-CPP. Continuous integration tools are provided by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp/actions){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mne-tools/mne-cpp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/mne-tools-mne-cpp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. For communication and project management we use GitHub Projects, [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mne-tools/mne-cpp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as well as [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mne-cpp/shared_invite/zt-cm5uwh2q-NLx92vkfNuT0Qf2iCq8TAA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. MNE-CPP's API documentation is build with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
