# Git Workflow

This part is focused on giving a short overview of git commands that should cover the general git workflow in MNE-CPP. For further information you can check out this [Git tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtLrWCFaG0A&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

The first steps to get started, as described in the [build guide](../install/buildguide.md), are:
```
git clone https://github.com/<YourGitUserName>/mne-cpp.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp.git
git fetch --all 
git rebase upstream/master
```

The general workflow is covered by the following steps:

- Create a new branch from `master`: 

```
git checkout -b <branchName> master
```

- Get the latest changes and [rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}: 

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

- Solve [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, if they occure. 

- Make your changes and check the status: 

```
git status
```

- Add unstaged changes (colored in red) to prepare next commit: 

```
git add <changedFileName>
   or
git add --all
```

- Commit the added files (colored in green in status report) and add a meaningful message about what changed and why (have a look at our [commit policy](conv_style.md)): 

```
git commit -m "Fix: meaningful commit message" 
   or 
git commit --all
```

- If you make small changes that are related to the previous commit, you can amend your changes to the previous commit with: 

```
git commit -m "Fix: meaningful commit message" --amend
```

- Push your changes to origin (your MNE-CPP fork on GitHub). Pleaes note that a force push via `-f` might be necessary if you rebased: 

```
git push origin <branchName>
   or
git push origin <branchName> -f
```
