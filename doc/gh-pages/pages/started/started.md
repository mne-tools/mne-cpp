# Get Started

This is the quickest way to get MNE-CPP up and running on your machine:

**1 Download MNE-CPP**

  [Download](../install/binaries.md) the latest stable release for the best stability, or the dev_build release for the latest features.

**2 Unzip the downloaded file**

  Extract the downloaded build into a folder on your machine

**3 Select the tool you wish to use from the `bin` folder**

  Currently we offer a real-time application: [MNE-Scan](../learn/scan.md); a visualization/analysis application: [MNE Analyze](../learn/analyze.md); and a data anonymization tool: [MNE Anonymize](../learn/anonymize).

**4 Follow the [guides](../learn/learn.md) on how to use MNE-CPP tools**
