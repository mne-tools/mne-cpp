This is the quickest way to get MNE-CPP up and running on your machine.

### 1. Download MNE-CPP.

Select your version and platform. Download the latest stable release for the best stability.

### 2. Unzip the downloaded file.
Extract the downloaded build into a folder on your machine

### 3. Select the tool you wish to use from the `bin` folder.

In the `bin` folder,  you will find:
  - A real-time analysis application: [MNE-Scan](../documentation/scan.md).
  - An offline visualization/analysis application: [MNE Analyze](../documentation/analyze.md).
  - An anonymization/deidentification tool for FIF files: [MNE Anonymize](../documentation/anonymize.md).

Using the latest stable release is recommended for users who wish to use MNE-CPP's command line tools and GUIs. But if you want to check out the latest features, try downloading the [development versions](../development/development.md).

We are also developing some of our aplications so that they can run directly on the browser. No need to install anything! See [On the browser](webasm.md).
