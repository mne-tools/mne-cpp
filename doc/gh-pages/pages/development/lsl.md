## Compilation of BrainFlow submodule

* Make sure that you have brainflow git submodule by typing

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp
# if you cloned the repo without recursive flag you will need to run
git submodule update --init
```

* Build it as a regular Cmake project but for MSVC you need to ensure that you use exactly the same Cmake Generator as for MNE-CPP, also you need to specify MSVC_RUNTIME dynamic(default is static). And specify -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\installed

Example of compilation:
```
cd applications\mne_scan\plugins\brainflowboard\brainflow\
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DMSVC_RUNTIME=dynamic -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=8.1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\\installed ..
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
cd ..
```

## BrainFlowBoard plugin setup

* After steps above make sure that you have brainflowboard uncommented in plugins.pro
* Build MNE Scan application
* BrainFlow has several dynamic libraries and JSON file which must be in your search path before you run BrainFlow based app, so you need to copypaste all dynamic libraries and brainflow_boards.json to your executable folder from brainflow\installed\lib

## BrainFlowBoard plugin UI

* You need to provide all inputs required for selected board and click 'Submit Params and Prepare Session' button. For information about inputs in BraiFlowBoard plugin widget use this [table](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SupportedBoards.html)
* After that you can start data streaming using play button
* If you need to change board or other parameters click 'Release Session' button and create a new one.
* [Optional] if you need to send config to a board, open setting widget and enter a config.
