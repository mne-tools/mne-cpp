Also, a good starting point is the DummyToolbox plugin, which you can find under `\mne-cpp\applications\mne_scan\plugins\dummytoolbox` or [here](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp/tree/master/applications/mne_scan/plugins/dummytoolbox){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. For example, you could make a copy and rename it to your wishes in order to get things started.
