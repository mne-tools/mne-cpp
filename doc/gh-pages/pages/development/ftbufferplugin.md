# MNE-SCAN FieldTrip Buffer Plugin

The plugin is meant to interface with a FieldTrip Buffer already running at a given address. It does not implement the buffer itself, only a client.

## Running with Neuromag

1. Set up .fif file

   Obtain a fif file generated by the neuromag with current sampling parameters and place it in the folder from which you run MNE-SCAN. Name that file `neuromag2ft.fif`

2. Download FieldTrip Neuromag2ft

   Download the source code either from their [website](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/) or their [github page](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip). This needs to be run on the acquisition computer for the neuromag.

4. Run neuromag2ft

   Run the executable `neuromag2ft`. If you downloaded the full source code, it is in `/realtime/src/acquisition/neuromag/bin` This should both create a buffer and start an interface with the neuromag. Run it with `--help` to view more options. Depending on your system, you might have to build it locally.

5. Set up plugin:

   Run MNE-Scan and select the FtBuffer plugin from the toolbar on the left. Set the buffer address and port and click the 'Set' button.

6. Send and receive data:

   In MNE-Scan, click the green start button on the top left to start the plugin. You are now ready to start collecting data.
