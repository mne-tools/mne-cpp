# Continuous Integration

We have invested a significant amount of effort into a completely automatic workflow of processes that validate that any new change to the codebase does not break the functionality of the code. This is verified before each and every single change to the codebase is added.

We do this with a combination of [Unit testing](writingtest.md), [Github Actions](ci_ghactions.md) and our enforced [contribution workflow](contr_guide.md). Please make sure you go through these documents in order to understand the whole development process.
