# Community

Currently we use [Github](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-cpp) to host the source code for MNE-CPP.

We use [Slack](https://mne-cpp.slack.com/) for communication.

Please [contact us](contact.md) with any questions you may have.

MNE-CPP is a result of collaboration with all of our [partners](partners.md).
