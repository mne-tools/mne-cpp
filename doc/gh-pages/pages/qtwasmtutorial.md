# MNE-CPP with QtWasm

### Setup Qt Wasm to work with MNE-CPP on Ubuntu 18.04.03 64bit:

 * Get emscripten compiler. According to the official Qt Wasm guide, preferred emscripten version are:
    Qt 5.12: 1.38.16
    Qt 5.13: 1.38.27 (multithreading: 1.38.30)
    Qt 5.14: it's complicated (1.38.27)

#### Some utils functions were not able to be linked against (undefined resource errors). It is possible that some mne-cpp functions are not compatible with emscripten 1.38.30. Some newer versions which are not officially tested with Qt Wasm, are able to be compiled succesfully, listed below:

    Qt5.13.2 compiled with em++ 1.39.3 with thread support and dispOpenGL flag via cmd line qmake -> Produced a lot of overlaying  window glitches. **Not recommended**

    Qt5.13.2 compiled with em++ 1.39.3 with thread support via cmd line qmake (not using QtCreator)

    Qt5.14.0 compiled with em++ 1.39.3 with thread support and dispOpenGL flag via cmd line qmake -> Produced a lot of overlaying  window glitches. **Not recommended**

    Qt5.14.0 compiled with em++ 1.39.3 with thread support  via cmd line qmake (not using QtCreator)

```
# Get the emsdk repo
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git

# Enter that directory and pull
cd emsdk
git pull

# Download and install the latest SDK tools.
./emsdk install 1.39.3

# Make the "latest" SDK "active" for the current user. (writes ~/.emscripten file)
./emsdk activate 1.39.3

# Activate PATH and other environment variables in the current terminal
source ./emsdk_env.sh
```
 * Build Qt from source. This is needed since we want to have threading support which is deactivated for the pre-built QtWasm build

    * Make sure to activate and source the correct emscripten version since the compiler will be used when building qt against wasm. You could also add this to your .basrc file. For example:
    ```
    ./emsdk activate 1.39.3
    source ./emsdk_env.sh
    ```
    * Install some dependencies (just to make sure)
    ```
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev python
    ```
    * Clone current Qt version. For example Qt 5.14.0:
    ```
    git clone -b 5.14.0
    https://code.qt.io/qt/qt5.git
    cd qt5
    ./init-repository -f --module-subset=qtbase,qtcharts,qtsvg
    ```
    * Navigate to parent directory, create new shadow build folder and cd into it:
    ```
    cd ..
    mkdir qt5_shadow
    cd qt5_shadow
    ```
    * Call configure from new working directory in order to perform a shadow build.

    With thread support (somehow this prevented quick and qml to be build, which are needed for mne_launch for example):
    ```
    ../qt5/configure -opensource -confirm-license -xplatform wasm-emscripten -feature-thread -nomake examples -no-dbus -no-ssl -prefix /home/lorenz/Qt/5.14.0/wasm_em1393_64_withThread
    ```
    Without thread support:
    ```
    ../qt5/configure -opensource -confirm-license -xplatform wasm-emscripten -nomake examples -no-dbus -no-ssl -prefix /home/lorenz/Qt/5.14.0/wasm_em1393_64_withThread
    ```

    * Build Qt and install to target (prefix) location afterwards. For mne-cpp we only need the qt charts, qtsvg and qtbase module (see [https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly) for officially supported modules):
    ```
    make module-qtbase module-qtsvg module-qtcharts -j8
    make install -j8
    ```
    * Qt Wasm should now be setup to work with the activated emscripten version


### Building MNE-CPP against QtWasm:

 * Navigate to mne-cpp/mne-cpp.pri and add the wasm flag. This will build mne-cpp statically and configure only wasm supported MNE-CPP code.

 ```
 MNECPP_CONFIG += wasm
 ```
 * Via QtCreator (Please note that this is still a bit glitchy and unstable. I ran into problems where QtCreator automatically called emscripten version 1.38.30 commands. Maybe because this is the recommended version):

     * Start the QtCreator and add the emscripten compiler with your installed version. Follow this tutorial:
     [https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-setup-webassembly.html](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-setup-webassembly.html)

     * If you want to switch the emscripten compiler version in QtCreator just clone the automatically found compiler and set the path to the following. This will always give you the compiler which was set via emsdk activate before starting QtCreator.

     ```
     /emsdk/upstream/emscripten/em++
     /emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc

     ```

     * Add the Qt wasm version to Qt Versions tab by navigating to the
     corresponding qmake location.

     * Create Kit featuring emscripten compiler and QtWasm version

     * Compile mne-cpp in QtCreator

 * Via qmake (This always worked for me):

     * Create shadow build folder, run qmake and build mne-cpp

     ```
     mkdir mne-cpp-shadow
     cd mne-cpp-shadow
     /home/lorenz/Qt/5.14.0/wasm_em1393_64_withThread/bin/qmake
     ../mne-cpp/mne-cpp.pro
     make -j8

     ```

 * This should create the applications featured under applications, e.g. MNE Browse, to be build to mne-cpp/bin

### Running an application:

 * Navigate to mne-cpp bin and start a server

  ```
  python3 -m http.server
  ```

 * Go to a suitable web browser (Chromium based and Mozilla browsers seem to work the best) and type:
     http://localhost:8000/mne_browse.html

### General notes:

 * CentOS7 at Martinos does not seem to have a high enough gcc version
     installed.

 * QtWebAssembly does not support concurrent and Qt3D modules.
     https://forum.qt.io/topic/109166/wasm-support-for-qt3d/4

 * Mne-cpp Code needs to be build statically

 * Thread support forQtWasm can be acchieved  since Qt5.13. Thread supportis deactivated in pre-built binaries. **Enabling** the default Qt for WebAssembly build disables threads by default. To enable, build from source and configure with the **-feature-thread** flag. Weâ€™ve found that emscripten 1.38.30 works well for threaded builds.

 * Data access for local files:
     https://forum.qt.io/topic/104608/access-local-user-file-on-qt-for-web-assembly and
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56886410/access-local-user-file-on-qt-for-web-assembly


 * Emscripten installer only supports 64 bit versions. 32bit needs to be build from scratch.

 * If you get a idbc error see here https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-79872


 * Browser support information: https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm

 * Qt5.14.0 with threading support, emscripten version 1.38.27 and qtbase as well as qtcharts module leads to this error: https://forum.qt.io/topic/108640/trying-to-configure-qt-for-windows-desktop-after-building-for-wasm. Qt5.13.2 does not seem to have this problem.
