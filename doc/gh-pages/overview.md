# Overview

Standalone MEG/EEG applications, especially for clinical use, e.g., acquisition, real-time processing or data browsing, comprise more or less fixed procedures, which have the need of being straightforward to use and fast in processing required tasks.

MNE-CPP can be used to build such standalone software applications, which offer a variety of neuroscientific tools and are easy to use. MNE-CPP provides a cross-platform library which allows the processing of MEG/EEG data. It can be used to develop cross-platform applications, which next to the common operation systems also include mobile devices and embedded systems.

Besides the basic library (MNE Lib) we deliver a number of applications, e.g., an acquisition and real-time processing application (MNE Scan), as well as an offline processing application (MNE Analzye). MNE-CPP is open source BSD licensed (clause 3) and can be freely accessed. MNE-CPP has two external dependencies, namely [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). 

We are targeting two user groups:
* Front-End users with little or no coding background. These users are interested in straight-forward setups and applications with an easy to use GUI, such as MNE Scan and MNE Analyze.
* Back-End users who are experienced with programming in C++ and want to use MNE-CPP functionalities to build their own applications. 

MNE-CPP is a community project. Contributions by new developers are always welcomed and greatly appreciated. If you are planning to contribute to MNE-CPP our [contributor page](pages/contribute/contribute.md) is a good point to start.

Currently, MNE-CPP's development efforts can roughly be divided into the following projects:

| ![MNELib](images/icon_mne-lib_256x256.png) | **MNE Lib** describes the core libraries provided by the MNE-CPP project. MNE Scan and MNE Analyze are solely based on these libraries. |
| ![MNEScan](images/icon_mne_scan_256x256.png) | **MNE Scan** (former MNE-X) is an open-source and cross platform application built with tools provided by the MNE-CPP framework. Currently, it is in active clinical use at the Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital. With its acquisition and algorithmic plugin architecture it is able to acquire and process data of several MEG/EEG systems (TMSI Refa, eegosports, gtec, brainamp, LSL, VectorView, BabyMEG) in real-time. |
| ![MNEAnalyze](images/icon_mne-analyze_256x256.png) | **MNE Analyze** is currently in an early development state. When finished it will provide easy to use GUI for sensor and source level analysis. |
