MNE-CPP is an open-source framework which offers a variety of software tools to the neuroscietific research community. We provide applications for the acquisition and processing of MEG/EEG data, both in real-time and offline. All applications are built on top of our cross-platform library which is available via an API and can be used to develop new tools.
