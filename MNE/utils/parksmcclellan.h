* @file     parksmcclellan.h
* @version  1.0
*
* ported to mne-cpp by Christoph Dinh and Florian Schlembach in February, 2014
*
*
* October 19, 2013
* From: http://www.iowahills.com/A7ExampleCodePage.html
*
* The original fortran code came from the Parks McClellan article on Wikipedia.
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks%E2%80%93McClellan_filter_design_algorithm
*
* This code is quite different from the original. The original code had 69 goto statements,
* which made it nearly impossible to follow. And of course, it was Fortran code, so many changes
* had to be made regardless of style.
*
* Our first step was to get a C version of the code working with as few changes as possible.
* Then, in our desire to see if the code could be made more understandable, we decided to
* remove as many goto statements as possible. We checked our work by comparing the coefficients
* between this code and our original translation on more than 1000 filters while varying all the parameters.
*
* Ultimately, we were able to reduce the goto count from 69 to 7, all of which are in the Remez
* function. Of the 7 remaining, 3 of these are at the very bottom of the function, and go
* back to the very top of the function. These could have been removed, but our goal was to
* clarify the code, not restyle it, and since they are clear, we let them be.
*
* The other 4 goto statements are intertwined in a rather nasty way. We recommend you print out
* the Remez code, tape the sheets end to end, and trace out the goto's. It wasn't apparent to
* us that they can be removed without an extensive study of the code.
*
* For better or worse, we also removed any code that was obviously related to Hilbert transforms
* and Differentiators. We did this because we aren't interested in these, and we also don't
* believe this algorithm does a very good job with them (far too much ripple).
*
* We added the functions CalcCoefficients() and ErrTest() as a way to simplify things a bit.
*
* We also found 3 sections of code that never executed. Two of the sections were just a few lines
* that the goto's always went around. The third section represented nearly half of the CalcCoefficients()
* function. This statement always tested the same, which never allowed the code to execute.
* if(GRID[1] < 0.01 && GRID[NGRID] > 0.49) KKK = 1;
* This may be due to the 0.01 minimum width limit we set for the bands.
*
* Note our use of MIN_TEST_VAL. The original code wasn't guarding against division by zero.
* Limiting the return values as we have also helped the algorithm's convergence behavior.
*
* In an effort to improve readability, we made a large number of variable name changes and also
* deleted a large number of variables. We left many variable names in tact, in part as an aid when
* comparing to the original code, and in part because a better name wasn't obvious.
*
* This code is essentially straight c, and should compile with few, if any changes. Take note
* of the 4 commented lines at the bottom of CalcParkCoeff2. These lines replace the code from the
* original Ouch() function. They warn of the possibility of convergence failure, but you will
* find that the iteration count NITER, isn't always an indicator of convergence problems when
* it is less than 3, as stated in the original Fortran code comments.
*
* If you find a problem with this code, please leave us a note on:
* http://www.iowahills.com/feedbackcomments.html

    * NumTaps must be odd for high pass and notch filters. Max number of taps is 128.
    * The arrays can handle up to 256 taps, but 128 is a good practical limit for convergence.
    * The minimum number of taps is 9 (maybe < 9, I forget the exact lower limit or what sets it)
    * OmegaC is the 3 dB corner freq for low pass and high pass filters.
    * It is the center freq for band pass and notch filters.
    * BW is the bandwidth for bandpass and notch filters (ignored on low and high pass).
    * OmegaC and BW are in terms of Pi. e.g. OmegaC = 0.5 centers a BPF at Omega = Pi/2.
    * The PM algorithm however uses frequencies in terms of 2Pi, so we need to to this: Edge[j] /= 2.0
    * ParksWidth is the width of the transition bands. For simplicity, we only use one width,
    * but the algorithm allows for unique values on every band edge.
    * Practical limits for ParksWidth are 0.02 - 0.15 for BPF and Notch,  0.02 - 0.30 for LPF and HPF.
    * TPassType is defined in the header file. LPF = Low Pass Filter, etc.
    * You should note our 0.01 minimum width for each band. This limit works well for the algorithm.
    * You will also find that OmegaC and BW need to be scaled a bit, depending ParksWidth, to get the
    * 3 dB corner frequencies to come in on target.

    * e.g. NewParksMcClellan(33, 0.7, 0.2, 0.1, HPF);
    * gives a 33 tap high pass filter with 3 dB corner at 0.7 with a transition bandwidth of 0.1
    * The FIR coefficients are placed in FirCoeff, starting at index 0.
