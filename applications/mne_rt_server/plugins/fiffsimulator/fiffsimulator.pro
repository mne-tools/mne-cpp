#  The QML_INFRA_FILES and QML_MESHES_FILES are both about QML based
# applications, so we'll install them into QT_INSTALL_DATA instead of
# QT_INSTALL_BINS
# QML_INFRA_FILES is used by our quick3d demos and examples to indicate files
# that are part of the application and should be installed (e.g. qml files,
# images, meshes etc).
# This conditional serves two purposes:
# 1) Set up a qmake extra compiler to copy relevant QML files at build time
#    to allow for a normal "change, make, test" developement cycle
# 2) Set up appropriate install paths on the same files to use "make install"
#    for building packages
