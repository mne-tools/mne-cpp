# {{name}}
Write a brief description of what your plugin does here. Keep it to roughly 2 or three sentences.

# Usage
Describe in more detail how your plugin works and explain how to use it. Include an explanation of its inputs and outputs, its important settings, and a screenshot or two. A picture is worth a thousand words.

# Development
This is where you explain the architecture of your plugin for anybody who might want to look at the source code. You should explain the architecture, important classes, their roles, and what parts of the code users might be interested in touching. If you designed any parts of your plugin to be extensible via subclassing or interfaces, you should explain that here.
